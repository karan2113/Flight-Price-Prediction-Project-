# Flight-Price-Prediction-Project-

This project predicts flight ticket prices using machine learning based on factors like airline, route, number of stops, journey date, and duration. The data was cleaned, encoded, and engineered to extract meaningful features. Exploratory Data Analysis was used to identify pricing patterns. Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated, and the best model was selected. The project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning skills using Python, data analysis, and model evaluation.
